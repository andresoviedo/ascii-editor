ASCII Editor
============

The basic idea of this project is to have an editor to design schemas, tables, drawings, etc. for making technical documentation that can be
used into the ubiquitous README files.

There is already some tools in internet like the awesome asciiflow, but I need something more professional and the asciiflow tool is not open source;
so I have decided to cook my own stuff and share it with the world :)


Try it!
